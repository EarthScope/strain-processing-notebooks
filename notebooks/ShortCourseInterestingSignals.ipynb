    "\n",
    "For these partner exercises, you will have a station and date range to explore. Your goal is to identify an interesting signal, using ```earthscopestraintools``` to better visualize and understand potential causes of the anomolous strain. You may explore other datasets and conduct simple research to complement your work (e.g., are there other strainmeters nearby to analyze? where is the instrument and what could be causing the signal?) - however, we request that you do NOT dive into the scientific literature, and remain data driven in your explorations. We suggest you start with a 1 Hz sampling rate for <1 mo of data, and 10 minute sampling period for >1 mo of data. You may decide on a better sampling rate for your signal after preliminary analyses. **Compile information for your projects with visuals in a mini powerpoint presentation to share with the group - please share your processing workflow along with your preliminary conclusions, as well as any code, instrumental, or other complications you encountered and how you overcame the issues.**\n",
